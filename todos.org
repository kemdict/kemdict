- sveltekit version release checklist
  - [X] Make sure it works on ancient browsers (probably)
  - [X] Make sure it works on browsers without JS (EWW, for instance)
  - [X] Switch DNS to point to Netlify instead of GitHub Pages
- [X] Some hakkadict entries, like =後生毋肯學,老來無安樂=, do not have ids
- [X] Use SvelteKit version as main version
  - We could then do the searching on the server side and avoid having to build 170000+ pages
- [X] mobile: include fonts (or use system fonts)
- [X] Incorporate Ministry of Education's Hakka dictionary
     [[https://hakkadict.moe.edu.tw/cgi-bin/gs32/gsweb.cgi/ccd=ChLpKc/description?id=MSA00000041&opt=opt2][It's also CC-BY-ND 3.0 TW]].
  - [X] Add it to [[https://github.com/kemdict/kemdict-data-ministry-of-education][kemdict-data-ministry-of-education]]
  - [X] Write the word template code for it
- [X] All titles should be written out as a file.
- [X] References should only be linked if it is available.
- [X] More dynamic search bar (which already requires JS)
  - We can avoid including titles.json in every file by just copying it to the output. We then have to do a request for it every time though. This is another case for rendering on first request.
- [X] A 404 page
- [X] Consider using Eleventy Serverless because we're on track to a million files in one folder at this rate. Although, who knows, maybe that's actually fine: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/197162/ntfs-performance-and-large-volumes-of-files-and-directories
  See [[file:internal-docs.org::df677ea0-0d20-4f07-bed2-df3d56fe4d45][Internal Docs: Rendering pages at first request instead of at build time]].
- [X] Fix stray <li>s for words without a type
- [X] Add links to search word in Moedict, Wiktionary, etc.
- [X] Copyright information for each dictionary like Weblio's footer
- [X] Dictionary header should link to the original dictionary, preferably to the same term
- [X] Make the search bar appear as if it's another window
- [X] =dict_idioms=: fix description in 一枕南柯
- [X] Fix search results not clickable
- [X] =dict_idioms=: fix showing missing fields
- [X] 更新重編國語辭典到最新
- [X] taigi: don't use ruby to display POJ
- [X] Figure out how to decode the ={[xxxx]}= thing
     No longer applicable as we don't use moedict-data anymore.
- [X] Add metadata
- [X] List (10) new words from kisaragi-dict at home page
     (Listing new words from MOE dictionaries requires keeping a record of all words from a previous version and comparing them with the current list. Doable but not relevant right now.)
- [X] Include information for when an entry was added in kisaragi-dict
- [X] Figure out an icon
* todos
- [ ] kisaragi-dict: use HTML in text content freely
- [ ] kisaragi-dict: transform Org links to HTML links during the data process step
- [ ] kisaragi-dict: implement eq-jp and eq-en (for changing links to Weblio or English Wiktionary)
- [ ] Backlinks lol
- [ ] =dict_concised=: add links to [例]A、B、C
- [ ] =dict_idioms=: add the △ ◎ symbols as documented [[https://dict.idioms.moe.edu.tw/pageView.jsp?ID=41][here]]
- [ ] Add list of dictionaries at top of word page to quickly navigate to
  - Or maybe checkboxes to hide a dictionary temporarily
- [ ] (This might blow up file count even more) pronunciation search: collect all pronunciations, then list all words with a given pronunciation for all pronunciations
- [ ] Potentially incorporate https://github.com/ChhoeTaigi/ChhoeTaigiDatabase
