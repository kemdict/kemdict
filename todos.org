** DONE try duckdb
** DONE Don't show keyboard shortcut on mobile (max-sm:hidden)
** DONE [#A] TOC: split sections for each language
** DONE Add C-k shortcut display to searchbar
** DONE A way to copy anchored links from the word page
  - See, for instance, NodeJS docs as a reference https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#enabling
  - Or Svelte's docs: https://svelte.dev/docs#compile-time-svelte-preprocess
** DONE Incorporate [[https://github.com/ChhoeTaigi/ChhoeTaigiDatabase/tree/master/ChhoeTaigiDatabase][iTaigi data]] (CC0)

Thank you Chhoe Taigi and iTaigi

- Data
- Word rendering
** DONE split dicts into its own repository
** DONE Fix concised dict formatting
Check the entry for 上
** DONE [#A] Table of contents
list of dictionaries at top of word page to quickly navigate to
plus the backlinks, “elsewhere”, and copyright sections
** DONE [#A] Backlinks
- Go through every definition to find links
  - Requires a common shape for the definition text
  - Right now it's either =word.heteronyms[n].definitions= or =word.heteronyms[n].definition= (n ∈ 0+)
  - The former is moedict-twblg and kisaragi-dict, the latter is kemdict/kemdict-data-ministry-of-education
  - We should flatten moedict-twblg and kisaragi-dict.
- Store links either as a table of =from, to= rows or in a column (with a JSON array) in the =entries= table?
** DONE an outgoing link component + outgoing indicator
** DONE [#A] Search by pronunciation (non-Han character search)
- For Mandarin, do we want to support pinyin?
- We want to support searching Taigi or Hakka with or without tones because I assume most speakers have not learned which tone is which…?
** DONE search: prefix, suffix, infix

- [X] Add a dropdown to select “begins with”, “ends with”, “includes”
- [X] Hook it up to the search view

** DONE there should be a separate “no search result” page
** DONE Add sitemap
** DONE Add robots.txt
** DONE Investigate memory leaks
It was being OOM killed because of other services on the same machine, (probably) not because of memory leaks.
** DONE Use a persistent database instead of spinning up an SQLite DB on every request
- Supabase should… work?
  - Find a way to get the dictionaries in there first
- Or just, you know, adapter-node on a VPS and cache with Cloudflare. We really don't need the infinite scaling.
  - This is what I'm using now.
** DONE =dict_concised=: add links to [例]A、B、C
** DONE kisaragi-dict: use HTML in text content freely
(sort of: Org content can be used freely, but I have to override parts of org-element-interpret-data to make it emit HTML)
** DONE kisaragi-dict: transform Org links to HTML links during the data process step
** DONE Search page; searchbar should submit to search page; server side prefix suffix infix (fuzzy?) search, ideally instant when switching modes
** DONE Do not send all words to client side
- This contributes to a lot of the jank
** sveltekit version release checklist
- [X] Make sure it works on ancient browsers (probably)
- [X] Make sure it works on browsers without JS (EWW, for instance)
- [X] Switch DNS to point to Netlify instead of GitHub Pages
** DONE Some hakkadict entries, like =後生毋肯學,老來無安樂=, do not have ids
** DONE Use SvelteKit version as main version
- We could then do the searching on the server side and avoid having to build 170000+ pages
** DONE mobile: include fonts (or use system fonts)
** DONE Incorporate Ministry of Education's Hakka dictionary
[[https://hakkadict.moe.edu.tw/cgi-bin/gs32/gsweb.cgi/ccd=ChLpKc/description?id=MSA00000041&opt=opt2][It's also CC-BY-ND 3.0 TW]].
- [X] Add it to [[https://github.com/kemdict/kemdict-data-ministry-of-education][kemdict-data-ministry-of-education]]
- [X] Write the word template code for it
** DONE All titles should be written out as a file.
** DONE References should only be linked if it is available.
** DONE More dynamic search bar (which already requires JS)
- We can avoid including titles.json in every file by just copying it to the output. We then have to do a request for it every time though. This is another case for rendering on first request.
** DONE A 404 page
** DONE Consider using Eleventy Serverless because we're on track to a million files in one folder at this rate. Although, who knows, maybe that's actually fine: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/197162/ntfs-performance-and-large-volumes-of-files-and-directories
** DONE Fix stray <li>s for words without a type
** DONE Add links to search word in Moedict, Wiktionary, etc.
** DONE Copyright information for each dictionary like Weblio's footer
** DONE Dictionary header should link to the original dictionary, preferably to the same term
** DONE Make the search bar appear as if it's another window
** DONE =dict_idioms=: fix description in 一枕南柯
** DONE Fix search results not clickable
** DONE =dict_idioms=: fix showing missing fields
** DONE 更新重編國語辭典到最新
** DONE taigi: don't use ruby to display POJ
** DONE Figure out how to decode the ={[xxxx]}= thing
No longer applicable as we don't use moedict-data anymore.
** DONE Add metadata
** DONE List (10) new words from kisaragi-dict at home page
(Listing new words from MOE dictionaries requires keeping a record of all words from a previous version and comparing them with the current list. Doable but not relevant right now.)
** DONE Include information for when an entry was added in kisaragi-dict
** DONE Figure out an icon
* Adding a dictionary
- kemdict-data: add code to download the raw data at build time
- kemdict-data: update process-data.el to merge the new dictionary into the intermediate json file
- kemdict-data: update combined-to-sqlite to include the new dictionary
- update [[file:./web/src/routes/word/\[word\]/+page.svelte][word page]] to use the right component for the new dictionary
- most likely, write a new word component for the new dictionary
- update dictionary list in common.js, README, and root route
- update copyright information
* todos
** less han-centric: eg. =/word/in= should show words / heteronyms which have title = in or pronunciation = in
- Return multiple word objects from word/server
- Accept multiple word objects in word/page
** fix a-a cham-cham
** Fallback: Noto CJK isn't good enough

𪜶 (for “their” in Taigi), for instance
(Unicode SIP, #x2A736)

Options:

- Iansui (like ChhoeTaigi)
- openhuninn

Possible options:

- Whatever MOE or moedict is using
- https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_Unicode_typefaces
- https://www.babelstone.co.uk/Fonts/Han.html
- 花園明朝 (it has an extension)
** update thanks, which is missing attribution to ChhoeTaigi and Taigi dictionaries
** about: justify kemdict considering chhoetaigi's existence
** update robots.txt to allow =/word/= to be indexed
** Search: put exact match on top
** Include more from ChhoeTaigi
** TODO [#A] Make copyright information more clear

- [X] implement for hakkadict
- [X] Prefix and suffix search
- [X] Fix the “matching on JSON string” atrocity
** TODO link to share on Twitter, Facebook, or just copy the URL
** TODO some way for the user to complain about or contribute kisaragi-dict definitions
Might require moving to YAML
** TODO varied links to moedict and chhoetaigi

Moedict dropdown → zh, nan, hakka
Chhoetaigi dropdown → Taigi, equivalent zh
Wiktionary dropdown → zh, en, ja

** TODO Search sort button needs to be styled
