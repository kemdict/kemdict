- [X] All titles should be written out as a file.
- [X] References should only be linked if it is available.
- [ ] Figure out how to decode the ={[xxxx]}= thing
- [ ] More dynamic search bar (which already requires JS)
  - We can avoid including titles.json in every file by just copying it to the output. We then have to do a request for it every time though. This is another case for rendering on first request.
- [ ] The word rendering is still broken.
- [ ] (This might blow up file count even more) pronunciation search: collect all pronunciations, then list all words with a given pronunciation for all pronunciations
- [X] A 404 page
- [ ] Potentially incorporate https://github.com/ChhoeTaigi/ChhoeTaigiDatabase
