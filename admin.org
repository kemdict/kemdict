* Adding a dictionary
- dicts: add code to Makefile to download the raw data at build time
- dicts: update process-data.el to include the new dictionary in the intermediate json file
- dicts: fill in info in data.ts and maybe README
- update [[file:./web/src/pages/word/\[title\].astro][word page]] to use the right component for the new dictionary
- most likely, write a new word component for the new dictionary
- update copyright information

* Testing
- Does search work?
  - "a", "a p" (prefix, suffix), "無妨", "zzz", "一"
  - Language tabs
  - Pagination
- Does word page rendering work?
  - "無妨" (taijit, concised, revised, =moedict_twblg=)
  - "實聯制" (kisaragi, itaigi)
- About
- Initial index + pagination, Radical index

* Why not make the DB its own service

I'm still not sure, but

- The network latency might be worse than running DB queries regardless of caching
- More attack vectors (?)
- Another interface to maintain within the same app
