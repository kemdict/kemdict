This will not build with adapter-cloudflare due to the use of builtin Node modules in my server modules.

* SvelteKit-based experiment

The goal of this version is to do the data access on the server (probably with Cloudflare Pages) so that we don't have to build 170000+ pages or download (and load in memory) 130MB worth of data.

As it's still experimental, the deploy is all manual.

The problems right now:

- We can't exactly ship a 130MB JSON to Cloudflare. (The limit is around 24MB.)
- Loading the entire JSON in a serverless function is going to be slow anyways.

We could just go back to building 170000+ pages and give up on that point. This can still be better than staying on Eleventy: at least now when we duplicate code between the app and the web versions it's more like a copy-paste and less like porting between Nunjucks and Svelte.
