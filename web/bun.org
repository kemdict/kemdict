* Using Bun

This project uses Bun as an opportunity for me to try it out.

There are three phases:

- During development, I'm using Node and pnpm.
- During build, I'm also using Node and pnpm.
- At runtime, dependencies are installed with pnpm and the server is [[./web/server/start][run with Bun]].

+Packages are already installed with Bun. I switched because it's really fast and seems to work fine.+

I reverted back to pnpm because:

- The server is doing this weird thing where it has no response and I'm trying to go back to a known good state

** Determining which packages need to be trusted

Bun now has =bun pm untrusted=.

** Dev-time and build-time
Using Bun during both development and build might be desirable, because it provides a nice implementation of macros.

Using Bun just for build possibly speeds up build times, though this doesn't matter much.
