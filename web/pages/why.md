# Why should Kemdict exist

## Wiktionary

- English Wiktionary is pretty good. But it's, well, in English.
- Chinese Wiktionary treats Chinese languages as dialects of one language, which is nonsense. Doing so causes it to be difficult to, say, actually assess dialects of Mandarin (ㄌㄜˋ ㄙㄜˋ versus ㄌㄚ ㄐㄧ etc.). That is a losing battle that I don't want to fight.

## iTaigi, ChhoeTaigi

Kemdict also covers modern Taiwanese Mandarin. Actually, Kemdict has more of a focus on Taiwanese Mandarin, and does not at all replace iTaigi or ChhoeTaigi.

## Moedict

- Its Mandarin data has not been updated in many years
- It doesn't have dict-idioms or dict-concised; the latter is not, in fact, just a concised version of dict-revised, as unexpected as that may be.
- Kemdict aggregates definitions from multiple sources for cross referencing
