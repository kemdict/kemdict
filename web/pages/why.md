# Why should Kemdict exist

## Wiktionary

- English Wiktionary is pretty good. But it's, well, in English.
- Chinese Wiktionary treats Chinese languages as dialects of one language, which is nonsense. Doing so causes it to be difficult to, say, actually assess dialects of Mandarin (ㄌㄜˋ ㄙㄜˋ versus ㄌㄚ ㄐㄧ etc.). That is a losing battle that I don't want to fight.

## iTaigi, ChhoeTaigi

Kemdict also covers modern Taiwanese Mandarin.

iTaigi is still the place to go for crowdsourced modern Taigi.

Right now Kemdict absolutely cannot replace ChhoeTaigi due to only supporting Han character-based search.

## Moedict

- Its Mandarin data has not been updated in many years
- It doesn't have dict-idioms or dict-concised; the latter is not, in fact, just a concised version of dict-revised, as unexpected as that may be.
- Kemdict aggregates definitions from multiple sources for cross referencing
